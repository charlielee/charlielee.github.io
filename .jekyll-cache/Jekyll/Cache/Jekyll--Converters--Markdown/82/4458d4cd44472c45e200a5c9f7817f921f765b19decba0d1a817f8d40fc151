I"à<p>As part of an Internet of Things module at university, I created a multiplayer version of the classic game Battleships for the â€œunPhoneâ€. The â€œunPhoneâ€ is a connected device powered by the ESP32 micro-controller and Adafruit kits. The ESP32 has an Arduino compatiblity layer, so Arduino C was used for development.</p>

<p>This was a joint assignment with my friend and coursemate Ben Scott.</p>
