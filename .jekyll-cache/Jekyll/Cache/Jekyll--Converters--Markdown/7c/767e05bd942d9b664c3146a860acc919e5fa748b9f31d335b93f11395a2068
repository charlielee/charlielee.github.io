I"õ<p><a href="https://github.com/charlielee/boats-animator/releases/tag/v0.10.0">Boats Animator 0.10.0</a> is now available. This version brings export to video, short play and you donâ€™t need to change directory every time you start the app anymore.</p>

<p>Captured frames now have a unique id in their file names that is generated on start up. This removes the risk of overwriting data and removes the need for the â€œcurrent save directory already contains captured frames!â€ warning message.</p>
